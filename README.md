# HH VRU App (Android)

This mobile application is a proof-of-concept for an MQTT supported Vulnerable Road User (VRU) protection application with the following characteristics:

Dynamic message triggering between 0.2 Hz and 10 Hz.
Circular Geofencing
User activity detection (e.g., walking, stationary, in vehicle)
Currently, the application must be running in the foreground to be able to update the VRU's location.

For a demonstration of the basic performance of this PoC, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcGm35zgVU8&ab_channel=AstaZeroAB

For an evaluation of this PoC read our IEEE ICVES 2022 article available on https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9986886
